; au3Irrlicht2 Changelog
; ======================
; this file is used to create history of help file. So it need to be well formated:
; empty lines or lines with leading ';' are ignored
; '=' in row1 defines header for release information (all '=' are removed for .html): 
; = [release number] ([date info]) ===========
; First found release info is also used to update the static introduction .html
; lines with '>' in row start a header
; lines with '+' in row start a list point in .html (with a bullet)
; lines with '-' in row start an ignored list point (history details not interesting for normal users)
; all following indented lines (starting in row >= 3) belong to the current .html or ignored list point
; '[' and ']' can be used to set text to bold in .html
  


=== 2.04 (2010-10-09) ==========================================================



> Script breaking changes:

+ _IrrAddSplineAnimator: Parameters changed to simplify usage (see examples)
+ _IrrGetNodePosition, _IrrGetNodeRotation, _IrrGetNodeAbsolutePosition,
  _IrrGetCameraTarget: Removed required byRef array parameter
  (see help file/adjusted examples for syntax)



> UDFs:

+ Fixed/Added: Some more working functions (mainly around added examples)
+ Added: Some missing 2D functions and documentation (contributions from smashly)
+ Fixed: _IrrSetFog (linear and exponential fog were interchanged)
+ Fixed: _IrrCreateMesh ($s_MeshName not being passed in the DLL call)
- Fixed: wrong return type in _IrrWriteMesh - "ptr:cdecl" is now "int:cdecl"
  Also reworked returned error codes
- _IrrSetZoneManagerBoundingBox, _IrrSetZoneManagerProperties:
  changed "ptr:cdecl" to "none:cdecl" as this dllcall doesn't offer a return.
- _IrrSetSkyDomeColor, _IrrSetSkyDomeColorBand, _IrrSetSkyDomeColorPoint, _IrrAnimateJoints: 
  changed "ptr:cdecl" to "none:cdecl" as this dllcall doesn't offer a return by call.
  These dll calls outputs printf errors straight to console.
+ Fixed: _IrrGetScreenCoordinatesFrom3DPosition (did not return anything useable because of wrong dllCall)



> Examples:

+ Added: 015 (CustomMesh), 022 (Indices+Vertices), 024 (Mesh to file), 062 (6D0F_Camera)
+ Added: (contribution from smashly): 039 (Texture blending), 070 (Texture_and_Images), 103 (Billboard Groups), 104 (LOD)
+ Added: 007/025/027/066/067/068/069/074/075 (ParticleSystem)
+ Reworked: 011 (Animators) shows usage of changed _IrrAddSplineAnimator
+ Fixed: 010 (TerrainAndFog) / 029/054 (Skydomes)
- 010: Corrected parameters and wrong documentation of _IrrSetFog. 029/054: renamed 
  skydome.jpg to 'skydome2.jpg' and restored original texture needed for example 054.



> Help file:

+ Added: Completed documentation including example code for some more functions.
  Current status: Topics completed along examples 1-16 + several more.
  At least naked reference w/o detailed informations for all functions inside other examples.
- Changed: Reworked several help file descriptions and examples.
+ Added: 'Copy to clipboard'-button for included examples (using VBS code from GEOSoft)



> Internal tools:

- Fixed: help_tool.au3 - added functions in UDFs w/o info block were not updated correctly.
+ Fixed: Examples could not be opened when running launcher from path with spaces
+ Added: Setup feature to example launcher to merge au3Irr2 help into local au3 help 
  and add/update calltips for SciTe
- calltip file and merged autoIt.chm are compiled into exampleLauncher.exe, so removed from root dir
+ Excluded \internal_tools because not too interesting for 99.9% (for the 0.1%: available via the 
  sources from project page)


> Other:
+ Changed: global $result used in UDF files switched to local variables (WIP, finished for 2D, Scene, 
  Camera, Animation, Node)


=== 2.03 (2010-09-05) ==========================================================

> UDF:

+ Changed: Splitted UDF per category into \include. Main UDF (and the only one which is
  needed to be included) is still au3Irrlicht2.au3
+ Changed: All used dll files are moved to \bin to clean up the root dir.
  _IrrStart is modified to find them anyway.
+ Fixed: _IrrSetNodeVisibility

> Examples:

+ Added: 089 (Orthogonal Camera), 106 (Advanced start)
+ Changed: 029 (Skydome)
+ Fixed: 049 (Loaded_Scene_Collision), 051 (Clouds)

> Help file:

+ Added: First version as reference of all working + proven functions. Current status:
  Topics completed including example code along examples 1 to 6.
  Naked reference w/o detailed informations for other examples.
+ Changed: Moved original freeBasic Wrapper docs from \FB_documentation to 
  \internal_tools\buildHelp\html_static. It's now included into help file.
+ Added: Merged help to use the au3Irr2 help inside the au3 help.

> Internal tools:

+ Added: helper scripts and files for building help file and au3.user.calltips.api
  (see [\internal tools\help_building_readme.txt]) 


> Other:
